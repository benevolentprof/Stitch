This repository contains a website for installing an Eclipse plugin 
for Stitch, a tool for creating and tracking concern maps.

A paper on this was submitted (but not accepted) to OOPSLA 2008 
and can be found in root directory in OOPSLA2008-zelda.pdf.

This tool went through a series of names, depending on the kind of 
concern maps that were created and the purpose they were used for. 
The names included Stitch, Zelda, and Cayley.
